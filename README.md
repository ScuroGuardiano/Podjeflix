A nice video player ^^

This shit is not finished and it's barely doing anything, so better leave it alone  
Also it can be insecure ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## But if you want...
You can run this  
Fire 2 terminals and type
```sh
ng serve
```
and in second terminal
```sh
npm run start-electron
```

This won't work without electron, so don't you even try opening it in the browser or the shit will happen.  
You will upset the balance of the Multiversum and eventually our entire Universe will colapse into a **_gargantuan fucking black hole™_**.  
**And it will be YOUR fault!**  
I've warned you!
